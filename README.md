# sclipt - Your CLI Snippet Manager üöÄ

sclipt is a command-line interface tool that helps you quickly store, list, view, delete, and search your code snippets right from your terminal. Designed for developers, it provides a fast and efficient way to manage reusable pieces of code without leaving your workflow.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Add Snippets**: Interactively add new snippets with a title, multi-line content, and tags.

```bash
sclipt add
```

### List All Snippets
Displays a list of all your saved snippets.
```bash
sclipt list
```

### View a Snippet
View the full content of a specific snippet by its unique ID.
```bash
sclipt view <snippet_id>
```
Example:
```bash
sclipt view 1718063234567
```

### Delete a Snippet
Permanently remove a snippet by its unique ID.
```bash
sclipt delete <snippet_id>
```
Example:
```bash
sclipt delete 1718063234567
```

### Search Snippets by Tag
Find snippets that have a specific tag.
```bash
sclipt search --tag <tag_name>
```
Example:
```bash
sclipt search --tag js
```
Or to find snippets tagged with `node`:
```bash
sclipt search --tag node
```

## üíª Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment.
- **fs.promises**: Node.js built-in module for asynchronous file system operations (to store snippets).
- **readline**: Node.js built-in module for interactive command-line input.
- **chalk**: For adding vibrant colors and styles to terminal output.
- **boxen**: For drawing beautiful ASCII art boxes around output sections and prompts.

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements (Ideas)
- **Search by Title/Content**: Extend search functionality to include keywords in titles or content.
- **Update Snippets**: Allow editing of existing snippet titles, content, or tags.
- **Export/Import**: Export snippets to a file (e.g., JSON, Markdown) or import from one.
- **Tag Management**: List all unique tags, rename tags.
- **Configuration**: Allow users to customize the `scliptend` keyword or default file location.
